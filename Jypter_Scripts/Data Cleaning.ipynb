    "## Data Sampling Inconsistencies \n",
    "From the first set of plots and len(dataframe), each sample set of data seems to have a slightly different number of samples. Which is accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see in the Arduino sketch and the subsequent python data logging sketch that I did not give it a sampling rate, or the frequency at which samples are taken. So I will have an inconsistent number of data points for each motion captured. With an unknown number of data points in each sample it can become difficult to train a machine learning model. So why did I choose to do this to my data?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. I wanted to test the consistency of my sensor and micro-controller real max data acquisition. With this knowledge I can set a fast but realistic sampling rate. \n",
    "2. The real world is filled with messy data. I wanted to gather a data set that I would have to clean and preprocess to use in model training. In other words, I wanted to test myself. \n",
    "\n",

    "From the Data exploration it seems that the number of samples for each motion is roughly between 250-260 samples per second. \n",
