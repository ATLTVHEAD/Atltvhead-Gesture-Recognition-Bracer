    "## Data Sampling Inconsistencies \n",
    "You can see in the Arduino sketch and the subsequent python data logging sketch that I did not give it a sampling rate, or the frequency at which samples are taken. So I will have an inconsistent number of data points for each motion captured. With an unknown number of data points in each sample it can become difficult to train a machine learning model. So why did I choose to do this to my data?\n",

    "1. I wanted to test the consistency of my sensor and micro-controller real max data acquisition. With this knowledge I can set a fast but realistic sampling rate. \n",
    "2. The real world is filled with messy data. I wanted to gather a data set that I would have to clean and preprocess to use in model training. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "From the Data exploration it seems that the number of samples for each motion is roughly between 250-260 samples per second or 750-780 samples for a single gesture. \n",
    "The output of the processed data should be a consistant number, because we need a known number of inputs into our model. This number will be 750 data points.  "
